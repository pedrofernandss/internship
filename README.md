## Internship Discord Bot

### Description

This is a speciall bot designed to search and find remote internship and/or entry-level software engineer and data science opportunities in Brazil. The collected information is sent to a specific Discord channel of my University to facilitate message organization and notification receipt.

## Objective

Given the difficulty in finding job opportunities for beginners, my goal with this project is to help my friends find opportunities to gain expirence and enter the industry. To achieve this, I developed this bot, which notifies them within an hour as soon as a job opening is posted. 

I believe that, due to the high competition in the job market, those who apply as quickly as possible have a higher chance of passing the first stage and being invited to move forward in the selection process.

## Technologies

Since this only a Proof of Concept, I choose to work with:

- Python
- SQLite

## Deploy

The project will be deployed on Azure and has a Github Actions attatched to the `main` branch for continuous deployment.

_P.s_: This project is my playground and my study room! I'm sorry if seems to have some overengineer rs
